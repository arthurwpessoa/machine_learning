## Introduction

This project analyzed a coffee shop dataset and used machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of pastry is needed/consumed on a given day, and compared the performance of the regression algorithms. Moreover, this notebook was created for the Machine Learning module on the MSc Computing program at Teesside University.

## Dataset
The experiments were conducted on a sample data module that contains representative retail data from a fictional coffee chain on the month of April 2019. 

The coffee shop inventory contains a series of information about the customer, generation, products, and sales targets, and staff, however, this analysis was only carried out against the pastry dataset.
