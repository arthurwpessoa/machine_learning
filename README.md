## Introduction

This project analyzed a coffee shop dataset and used machine learning algorithms to predict the amount of pastry is needed/consumed on a given day, and described the possible outliers in the results. Moreover, this notebook was created for the Machine Learning module on the MSc Computing program at Teesside University.

## Running the notebook
From the cloned directory, run the following command, and select the pastry.ipynb notebook.

    $ cd notebook
    $ jupyter notebook
